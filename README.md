# Vagrant Instructions

Make sure you have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed. Next, download the repo and run the following command in the project root to provision your Vagrant machine:

```bash
vagrant up
```

After the provisioning finishes, you can access the project at [`localhost:3333`](http://localhost:3333). That's it!

## Accessing the vagrant box

To access the vagrant machine, use `vagrant ssh`. This will ssh into your
vagrant machine. All application code is located in `/vagrant`.

## Running Tests

Navigate to the `/vagrant` directory within vagrant and `rspec`.

### Setup

To setup the database, run:

```bash
bundle exec rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
bundle exec rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test
```
