Make sure you have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed. Next, download the repo and run the following command in the project root to provision your Vagrant machine:

```bash
vagrant up
```

After the provisioning finishes, you can access the project at [`localhost:3333`](http://localhost:3333). That's it!
